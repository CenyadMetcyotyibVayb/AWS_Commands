Create VPC endpoints to use Systems Manager to manage private EC2 instances without internet access

Amazon EC2 instances must be registered as managed instances to be managed with AWS Systems Manager. Follow these steps:

1. Verify that SSM Agent is installed on the instance.
     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-prereqs.html#prereqs-ssm-agent
2. Create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) instance profile for Systems Manager.
     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/setup-instance-profile.html
3. Attach the IAM role to your private EC2 instance.
4. Open the Amazon EC2 console, and then select your instance. On the Description tab, note the VPC ID and Subnet ID.
5. Create a VPC endpoint for Systems Manager.
     For Service Name, select com.amazonaws.region.ssm.
     For VPC, choose the VPC ID for your instance.
     For Subnets, choose the Subnet ID for your instance. Be sure to create the endpoint in all subnets in the VPC.
     For Enable Private DNS Name, select Enable for this endpoint.
     For Security Group, select an existing security group, or create a new one. The security group must allow inbound traffic from your instance on port 443. If you create a new security group, note the Group ID.
6. Repeat step 5 with the following change:
     For Service Name, select com.amazonaws.region.ec2messages.
7. Repeat step 5 with the following change:
     For Service Name, select com.amazonaws.region.ssmmessages.
8. If you created a new security group, open the VPC console, choose Security Groups, and then select the new security group. On the Inbound Rules tab, choose Edit rules. Add a rule with the following details, and then choose Save rules.
     For Type, choose HTTPS.
     For Source, choose your VPC/Subnet CIDR.
